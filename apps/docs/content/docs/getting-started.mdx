## What is react-native-scenes?

react-native-scenes is an open-source component library for React Native, inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). It provides ready-to-use screens, scenes, and UI blocks that you can add to your React Native projects.

Instead of shipping components as an npm package, react-native-scenes follows the shadcn philosophy: components are copied directly into your project, giving you full ownership and control. You can install them via the shadcn CLI or simply copy and paste the code.

<Callout type="info">
  **Compatible with shadcn Registry**: react-native-scenes implements the shadcn registry specification, making it compatible with
  the shadcn CLI tooling.
</Callout>

## Philosophy

This is not a traditional component library. You don't install it as a dependency. Instead, you pick the scenes and components you need, add them to your project, and adapt them to your requirements.

- **Copy-paste friendly**: Browse the components and copy the code directly into your project
- **CLI support**: Use the shadcn CLI to quickly add components to your app
- **Full ownership**: Components live in your codebase - modify them however you need
- **No vendor lock-in**: No package updates to worry about, no breaking changes

## Preview
You may preview the project and explore the components using Expo GO, scan the QR code below to open it in the Expo Go app.

## Base Components

react-native-scenes is built on top of base UI components from [React Native Reusables](https://reactnativereusables.com/docs). These components have been slightly modified and adapted to work seamlessly with the blocks in this library.

## Why react-native-scenes?

- **Boost development velocity**: Skip the boilerplate and start with production-ready screens
- **Fully customizable**: Components use Tailwind CSS classes - modify styles to match your brand
- **Install only what you need**: Add scenes individually - no bloated dependencies
- **Own your code**: Components are copied into your project, giving you full control
- **Modern stack**: Built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and React Native best practices

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your React Native project has **Tailwind CSS** configured. react-native-scenes requires either:

- **[Uniwind](https://docs.uniwind.dev)** (Recommended) - Faster and compatible with Tailwind CSS v4
- **[NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev)** - Alternative Tailwind CSS implementation

<Callout type="warn">
  **Uniwind is recommended** for better performance and Tailwind CSS v4 compatibility. If you haven't set up Tailwind
  CSS yet, follow the [Uniwind installation guide](https://docs.uniwind.dev/getting-started/installation).
</Callout>

## Credits

react-native-scenes builds upon the excellent work of the React Native community:
